## Project Overview

Alloy is a Go-based React/TSX SSR framework with optional hydration and asset serving. It uses QuickJS for server-side rendering, esbuild for bundling, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The framework enables writing React components that are rendered on the server (Go) and hydrated on the client.
